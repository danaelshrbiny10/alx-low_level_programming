# 0x00. C - Hello, World
- In this project, I learned about compilation using `gcc`, entry points using `main`, and text-printing functions in C. `GCC` is basically a C compiler.

---
- [0-preprocessor](./0-preprocessor) : Bash script that runs a C file saved in the variable `$CFILE` through the preprocessor and saves the result in the file `c`.
- [1-compiler](./1-compiler) : Bash script that compiles a `C` file saved in the variable `$CFILE` that does not link saves the result in an output file of the same name but with a `.o` extension.
- Example: If the C file is `main.c`, the output is `main.o`.
